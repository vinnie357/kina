# Apple Container Integration Task Status

**Task**: Apple Container Integration Layer
**Phase**: Phase 2 (Core Features)
**Status**: Not Started
**Created**: 2025-01-20
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-20

## Progress Overview
- **Status**: Awaiting Phase 1 completion
- **Completion**: 0%
- **Next Action**: Await Apple Container research findings from Phase 1

## Implementation Components Status
- [ ] Apple Container CLI wrapper implementation
- [ ] Container struct and lifecycle management
- [ ] Configuration builders and validators
- [ ] Basic container operations (CRUD)
- [ ] Asynchronous operation support
- [ ] Error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Integration testing with real Apple Container
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

## Technical Components Status
- [ ] Rust module structure design
- [ ] Apple Container CLI command execution
- [ ] Container configuration management
- [ ] Error classification and handling
- [ ] Resource cleanup mechanisms

## Testing Status
- [ ] Unit tests for wrapper functions
- [ ] Integration tests with Apple Container
- [ ] Error handling scenario tests
- [ ] Performance and reliability tests

## Dependencies
- **Phase 1**: Apple Container research must complete with positive feasibility assessment
- **External**: Working Apple Container installation required
- **Technical**: Rust async runtime selection needed

## Current Blockers
Waiting for Phase 1 Apple Container research completion to understand:
- Apple Container API capabilities and limitations
- Optimal integration patterns and approaches
- Performance characteristics and constraints
- Error conditions and handling requirements

## Risk Factors
- Apple Container API may have undocumented limitations
- Performance may not meet cluster operation requirements
- Integration complexity may exceed estimates

## Notes
This is the foundational integration layer for all Apple Container operations. Quality and reliability of this implementation directly impacts all subsequent features.
