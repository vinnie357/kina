I am a comprehensive Rust CLI project orchestration command that coordinates discovery-driven workflows through parallel specialized agents. My task is to:

1. Parse workflow arguments for Rust CLI development context
2. Use TodoWrite to manage orchestration workflow phases
3. Coordinate parallel workflow execution through specialized agents
4. Validate and consolidate workflow outputs
5. Create comprehensive project development reports

## Implementation

I will use TodoWrite to track progress through managed orchestration phases:

Use TodoWrite to start Phase 1 - Workflow Analysis and Coordination Setup.

**Parallel Workflow Coordination** (Run multiple Task invocations in SINGLE message based on workflow_type):

**For Discovery Workflows:**
- Task with subagent_type: "discovery-agent" - pass the project_path argument for comprehensive Rust CLI project analysis
- Task with subagent_type: "research-specialist" - pass the project_path argument for Rust ecosystem research and container orchestration analysis

**For Development Workflows:**
- Task with subagent_type: "prd-agent" - pass the project_path argument for CLI requirements specification
- Task with subagent_type: "plan-agent" - pass the project_path argument for implementation planning
- Task with subagent_type: "task-agent" - pass the project_path argument for task breakdown and execution contexts

**For Quality Workflows:**
- Task with subagent_type: "code-quality-analyzer" - pass the project_path argument for Rust code quality assessment
- Task with subagent_type: "security-review-coordinator" - pass the project_path argument for CLI security analysis
- Task with subagent_type: "documentation-coordinator" - pass the project_path argument for comprehensive documentation generation

Use TodoWrite to complete Phase 1 - Workflow Analysis and Coordination Setup.

Use TodoWrite to start Phase 2 - Specialized Workflow Execution.

**Sequential Specialized Execution** (Based on discovered requirements):
- Task with subagent_type: "implement-agent" - pass the project_path argument for coordinated implementation execution
- Task with subagent_type: "test-review" - pass the project_path argument for testing framework evaluation

Use TodoWrite to complete Phase 2 - Specialized Workflow Execution.

**CRITICAL: NEVER fabricate workflow results or project capabilities. Only report findings from actual analysis and execution.**

**Rust CLI Development Focus:**
This orchestration command specializes in:
- **Project Discovery**: Cargo.toml analysis, dependency evaluation, module structure assessment
- **CLI Architecture**: Command parsing patterns, configuration management, container integration
- **Development Workflows**: Cargo build optimization, testing strategy, CI/CD integration
- **Quality Assurance**: rustfmt, clippy, security auditing, documentation generation
- **Container Integration**: Apple Container workflows, Kubernetes API integration, deployment patterns

**Workflow Types:**
- `discovery`: Comprehensive project analysis and technology stack evaluation
- `development`: Full development workflow (PRD → Plan → Tasks → Implementation)
- `quality`: Code quality, security, and documentation workflows
- `integration`: Container and Kubernetes integration workflows
- `migration`: Legacy system migration and modernization workflows

**Example Usage:**
```bash
/claudio:claudio discovery                              # Full project discovery
/claudio:claudio development "CLI rewrite"              # Development workflow
/claudio:claudio quality ./my-rust-project              # Quality assessment
/claudio:claudio integration "Kubernetes migration"     # Integration workflow
```

**Rust Ecosystem Integration:**
- **Cargo Workspace**: Multi-package project coordination and dependency management
- **CLI Frameworks**: clap, structopt, or argh integration analysis
- **Container Tools**: Docker, Apple Container, and Kubernetes client libraries
- **Testing Tools**: cargo test, proptest, criterion benchmarking integration
- **Quality Tools**: rustfmt, clippy, cargo-audit, cargo-deny integration

**Output Coordination:**
- Consolidated workflow reports in `.claudio/docs/`
- Phase-based implementation plans in `.claudio/phase*/`
- Quality assessment reports with actionable recommendations
- Integration guides for container orchestration workflows

This demonstrates comprehensive Rust CLI project orchestration with discovery-driven workflow coordination and specialized agent integration.
