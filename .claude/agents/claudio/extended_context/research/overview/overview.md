# Research Context for Rust CLI Application

## Project-Specific Guidance
Based on discovery analysis, this project requires research support for Apple Container integration, Kubernetes client library selection, and Rust CLI development patterns for container orchestration applications.

## Recommended Approaches
- **Apple Container Research**: Investigate container runtime capabilities, API availability, and system integration patterns
- **Kubernetes Client Analysis**: Evaluate kube-rs vs kubernetes-rs libraries for CLI application requirements
- **Rust CLI Patterns**: Research existing CLI applications for architecture patterns and user experience design
- **Performance Research**: Analyze container startup performance and resource usage optimization strategies

## Integration Patterns
Research integrates with development workflow through:
- Technical proof-of-concept development for Apple Container integration validation
- Library evaluation and benchmarking for Kubernetes client selection decisions
- Architecture pattern analysis for scalable CLI application design
- User workflow research for optimal command structure and interface design

## Quality Standards
- **Technical Validation**: All research includes practical validation through prototype development and testing
- **Documentation Standards**: Research findings documented with examples, limitations, and implementation guidance
- **Decision Tracking**: Clear documentation of technology choices with rationale and alternative analysis
- **Update Procedures**: Regular research updates as technologies evolve and project requirements change

## Next Steps
- Conduct Apple Container API research with practical integration testing
- Evaluate Kubernetes client libraries with performance and functionality comparison
- Analyze successful Rust CLI applications for pattern identification and best practices
- Research container orchestration user workflows for optimal CLI design patterns
