# Research Troubleshooting for Rust CLI Application

## Common Issues

### Limited Apple Container Documentation
**Problem**: Insufficient official documentation for Apple Container API integration
**Solution**: Engage with Apple developer communities, analyze existing container tools, and develop experimental prototypes to understand API capabilities and limitations.

### Kubernetes Client Library Decision Paralysis
**Problem**: Difficulty choosing between kube-rs and kubernetes-rs without clear comparison criteria
**Solution**: Create comparative prototypes implementing basic cluster operations with both libraries. Evaluate based on CLI-specific requirements like performance, error handling, and API completeness.

### Outdated Research Information
**Problem**: Research findings become obsolete as Apple Container and Kubernetes ecosystems evolve
**Solution**: Establish regular research update cycles tied to technology release schedules. Maintain version compatibility tracking and impact assessment procedures.

### Insufficient Practical Validation
**Problem**: Research findings lack practical implementation validation and real-world testing
**Solution**: Require prototype development for all major research conclusions. Include performance testing, error scenario analysis, and integration complexity assessment.

## Debug Strategies
- **Prototype Development**: Create minimal working examples for all research findings validation
- **Community Engagement**: Participate in relevant developer communities for insights and validation
- **Iterative Research**: Regular research updates based on implementation feedback and technology evolution
- **Documentation Standards**: Maintain clear research documentation with decision rationale and validation results

## Getting Help
- **Apple Developer Resources**: Engage with Apple developer support and community forums for container runtime insights
- **Rust Community**: Participate in Rust CLI development communities for pattern guidance and best practices
- **Kubernetes Ecosystem**: Connect with Kubernetes client library maintainers and user communities for implementation guidance
- **Open Source Examples**: Study existing open source tools for architecture patterns and implementation approaches
