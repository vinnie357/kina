# Workflow Templates Context for Rust CLI Application

## Project-Specific Guidance
Based on discovery analysis, this project requires workflow templates for Rust CLI development lifecycle with Apple Container integration and Kubernetes orchestration feature development.

## Recommended Approaches
- **Rust Development Workflows**: Templates for cargo workspace setup, dependency management, and CLI framework implementation cycles
- **Apple Container Integration Workflows**: Research workflows, prototype development, and system integration validation processes
- **Kubernetes Client Workflows**: Library evaluation, API integration, and cluster operation testing procedures
- **CLI Feature Development Workflows**: Command implementation, user experience testing, and help documentation synchronization

## Integration Patterns
Workflow templates integrate with development processes through:
- Cargo-based development cycles with automated testing and quality validation
- Apple Container research and integration workflows with prototype validation and system testing
- Kubernetes client integration workflows with API compatibility testing and cluster operation validation
- CLI development workflows with user experience testing and documentation generation

## Quality Standards
- **Incremental Development**: Workflow templates support iterative development with clear milestone validation
- **Integration Testing**: All workflows include integration testing with real Apple Container and Kubernetes instances
- **Platform Validation**: Workflows account for macOS platform requirements and system integration testing
- **Documentation Synchronization**: Workflow templates include documentation updates and validation processes

## Next Steps
- Create Rust development workflow templates with cargo integration and quality gate validation
- Develop Apple Container research and integration workflow templates with system validation procedures
- Establish Kubernetes client integration workflow templates with API testing and cluster validation
- Define CLI feature development workflow templates with user experience testing and documentation synchronization
