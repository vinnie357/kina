# Workflow Templates Troubleshooting for Rust CLI Application

## Common Issues

### Workflow Templates Too Generic
**Problem**: Workflow templates don't account for Apple Container integration complexity and research requirements
**Solution**: Customize workflows with Apple Container-specific research phases, prototype validation steps, and system integration testing procedures.

### Missing Rust CLI Development Patterns
**Problem**: Workflow templates lack Rust-specific development cycles and CLI framework integration steps
**Solution**: Include cargo workspace workflows, CLI framework integration steps, and Rust-specific testing and quality validation procedures.

### Insufficient Integration Testing Workflows
**Problem**: Workflow templates don't include real system testing with Apple Container and Kubernetes integration
**Solution**: Develop workflow templates with integration testing phases, system validation procedures, and error scenario testing workflows.

### Workflow Dependency Management Issues
**Problem**: Workflow templates don't properly sequence Apple Container research, Rust development, and Kubernetes integration dependencies
**Solution**: Create clear dependency mapping between research phases, prototype development, and integration testing with proper prerequisite validation.

## Debug Strategies
- **Workflow Validation**: Test workflow templates with actual development scenarios and integration requirements
- **Dependency Testing**: Validate workflow dependencies and prerequisite checking with real development sequences
- **Integration Scenarios**: Test workflows with various system configurations and technology integration scenarios
- **Error Recovery**: Ensure workflow templates include error recovery procedures and rollback strategies

## Getting Help
- **Rust Development Workflows**: Study successful Rust CLI projects for development lifecycle patterns and workflow design
- **Apple Container Integration**: Research container runtime integration workflows and system validation procedures
- **Kubernetes Development**: Analyze Kubernetes tooling development workflows and client library integration patterns
- **CLI Development Processes**: Reference CLI application development workflows and user experience validation procedures
