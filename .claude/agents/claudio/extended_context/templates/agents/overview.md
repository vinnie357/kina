# Agent Templates Context for Rust CLI Application

## Project-Specific Guidance
Based on discovery analysis, this project requires agent templates customized for Rust CLI development with Apple Container integration and Kubernetes orchestration workflows.

## Recommended Approaches
- **Rust Development Agents**: Templates for cargo workspace management, dependency analysis, and CLI framework integration
- **Apple Container Agents**: Specialized templates for container runtime research, integration testing, and system validation
- **Kubernetes Integration Agents**: Templates for client library evaluation, cluster operation validation, and API compatibility testing
- **CLI User Experience Agents**: Templates for command structure analysis, user workflow validation, and help documentation generation

## Integration Patterns
Agent templates integrate with development workflow through:
- Rust-specific analysis patterns with cargo metadata integration and crate structure validation
- Apple Container validation agents with system privilege checking and runtime availability testing
- Kubernetes client testing agents with cluster connectivity validation and API operation testing
- CLI testing agents with assert_cmd integration and user experience validation

## Quality Standards
- **Technology Specificity**: All agent templates include Rust, Apple Container, and Kubernetes-specific validation patterns
- **Platform Awareness**: Templates account for macOS platform requirements and Apple Container system integration
- **Integration Testing**: Agent templates include patterns for integration testing with real container and cluster instances
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling patterns for container runtime failures and Kubernetes connectivity issues

## Next Steps
- Create Rust development agent templates with cargo integration and CLI framework patterns
- Develop Apple Container agent templates with system validation and integration testing
- Establish Kubernetes agent templates with client library evaluation and cluster operation testing
- Define CLI user experience agent templates with workflow validation and documentation generation
